This game does not have an internal debugger. The demo version however, does, and its interpreter can be used with the full version. This may have some restrictions, since some versions of the game use a more recent interpreter than the demo, which potentially can cause problems. Please refer to 4.1 on how to swap interpreters in the early SCI1 games.
