# SCI Debug Resources

Many of Sierra's SCI games, such as King's Quest IV, Space Quest III, etc., have a script debugger in addition to the internal debugger. SCI0 debugging is typically activated with a secret phrase, such as PUMP SHARK in SQ3, but SCI1 games typically require a patch file to be exported to enable debugging. 

Currently a work in progress.
