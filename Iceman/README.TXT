Codename: Iceman v1.033 debugger

The script debugger was removed from all retail versions of Codename: Iceman. However, around 2020, youtuber LGR purchased an old PCjr that had a beta verion on the hard drive that included the debugHandler script #307. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-VBITW94zI

This patch ports the debugger into the most recent retail release. Like in the beta, the "debug help" message has been added to the menu below "about". Also like in the beta, the debugger is not available in the following rooms: 11 99 27 3 39 33 25


Installation

Copy script.307, text.307, script.818, script.818, script.997 and text.997 into the iceman game folder and start normally.

Though it's not listed in the debug help, you can also give yourself inventory items by typing the following command:

GIVE [invItem] TO EGO

Only a subset of the Codename: Iceman inventory is available at any given point of the game. So you cannot get the "bomb" at the start of the game, because the game itself doesn't know about it until later.

Main inventory items:
Envelope
Film
ID

Sub inventory items:
Bomb
Bottle
Key
Diver
Flair
Device
Pin
Washer
Nut
Cylinder
Caliper
Book
Hammer
Wrench
Sheared cylinder
