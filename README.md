# SCI Debug Resources

Many of Sierra's SCI games have a script debugger in addition to an internal debugger. SCI0 script debugging is typically activated with a secret phrase such as PUMP SHARK in SQ3. 

SCI1 games often require a patch file to be exported to enable debugging. 

If it hasn't been removed the internal debugger is started with LSHIFT+RSHIFT+"-", otherwise this command will crash the game.

Currently a work in progress.
