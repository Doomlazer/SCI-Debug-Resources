# KQIV Whale Tongue Accessibility Patch
 
## Version 3

This replaces the control pic of the whale's belly making it trivial to climb.
It also fixes a bug in the original game that would otherwise cause a lock up when falling off the top of the tongue.

V2.0 expands things to remove death by falling in almost every location of the game, with one intentional exception.

v3.0 now supports the floppy version of KQ4 as well.
Most user will have the disk version, but see 'Floppy Version Patches\FloppyInstructions.txt' for details.
 
This patch does NOT remove fall damage from the ocean cliffs, it's tricky to prevent without glitches because of overlaping control colors.
If they need be put back into the mod for accessability reasons, please let me know.

# Installation:

Quick install: Dump all the files in your base game folder. For ScummVM put them in a folder called PATCH.

The patch files can be added and removed from the KQ4 game folder as needed.
They are all in the format pic.xxx and are identified below.
Most users can ignore the 'Floppy Version Patches' folder.
 

## Whale belly - you must copy both pic.044 and script.044 for this location otherwise the game locks up after falling off the tongue.

Note: I added a sliver of ctlGREEN on the back edge (red arrow). Don't forget to save and fall from the top! (make sure you're using the EGA320.DRV in dosbox or you will not get ShakeScreen at the bottom). The purple arrow indicates I've made the organ flush with the back wall. This makes it easy to slide in and out of the organ.
