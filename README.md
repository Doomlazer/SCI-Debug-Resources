# SCI Debug Resources

Many of Sierra's SCI games include a script debugger in addition to an internal debugger. SCI0 script debugging is typically activated with a secret phrase, such as PUMP SHARK in SQ3. SCI1 games often require a patch file to be exported to enable debugging. This repo provides those files. Additional debugging commands have been added for certain games.

If it hasn't been removed, the internal debugger is started with LSHIFT+RSHIFT+"-", otherwise this command will crash the game.

Work in progress.
