v0.009
https://sciprogramming.com/community/index.php?topic=9150.0

Installation: 
=============
Minimum installation:
Copy all files in to your EQ2 game folder and start normally. 
You should see a "Where to, Mac?" prompt at the start of the game.

There are two mouse debug commands (see commands section) that require copying 0.scr to the KQ6 game folder to work, but this is optional. 

Kawa's interpreter: Included is SCI.EXE and the DBHELP.00x help files which feature a restored interpreter debugger.
It enables many additional debugging tools such as breakpoints, stack trace, etc..
SCI.EXE can be renamed to SIERRA.EXE to replace the standard interpreter in the KQ6 game folder.
Make sure to copy over the 3 DBHELP.00x files into the KQ6 game folder as well if you're going to use it. 
See SCI.EXE_Interpeter_README.txt for additional details 

Usage
=====

Press Shift + / to see a list of available debug commands.

Press LeftShift + RightShift + '-' (minus_key) to start the SCI.exe interpreter debugger.
