Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist
The "magic" script is 10. However, this script cannot be found in the English release of Freddy Pharkas. Extract 10.SCR/10.HEP/10.TEX from the RESOURCE.MSG file (instead of the usual RESOURCE.000) in a NON-ENGLISH(!) release. I've tested this with the German, Spanish and French release. The extracted script will work with every version of the game, also the English one.

[note: Exporting 29.scr and 29.hep from the forign language version adds a "Where to?" feature and other additional options at the start of game.]
