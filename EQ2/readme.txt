Eco Quest 2 Debugger Restoration
v0.009
https://sciprogramming.com/community/index.php?topic=9150.0

Installation: 
=============
Minimum installation:
Copy all files in to your EQ2 game folder and start normally. 
You should see a "Where to, Mac?" prompt at the start of the game.

Kawa's interpreter: Included is SCI.EXE and the DBHELP.00x help files which feature a restored interpreter debugger.
It enables many additional debugging tools such as breakpoints, stack trace, etc..
Note: ScummVM uses it's own internal debugger and will ignore SCI.EXE
SCI.EXE can be renamed to SIERRA.EXE to replace the standard interpreter in the EQ2 game folder or launched without renaming. 
See SCI.EXE_Interpeter_README.txt for additional details. 

Usage
=====

Press Shift + / to see a list of available debug commands.

Press LeftShift + RightShift + '-' (minus_key) to start the SCI.EXE interpreter debugger.
