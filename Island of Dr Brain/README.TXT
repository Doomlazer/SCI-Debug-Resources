Island of Dr. Brain Debugger 
Seems to work on both the floppy and CD version

ISTALLATION 

Copy files 800.scr and 800.hep to game folder and start normally. 


Since script 800.scr is missing from the game files it needs to be recreated from scratch.
More commands could be added, but it was pain enough getting TP to work. If anyone is interested in better debugging for this game let me know, but it's a low priority for me at the moment.

Commands

[ALT + N]	QA Logger
[ALT + C]	Show control
[ALT + V]	Show visual 
[ALT + P]	Show priority
[ALT + T]	Teleport
