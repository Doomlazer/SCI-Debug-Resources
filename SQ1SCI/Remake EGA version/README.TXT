Space Quest I Remake EGA version Debugger 

INSTALLATION

Copy 0.scr into your game folder and start normally.
This is only for the much rarer EGA version of the SQ1 remake!


Since the debug script is missing I've added commands into main. 

[ALT + c]	Show control view
[ALT + v]	Show normal view
[ALT + c]	Show prority view
[ALT + t]	Teleport 
[ALT + i]	Get inventory number
