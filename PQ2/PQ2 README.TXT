Police Quest II version 1.002.011 Debugging

Notice: until recently the phrase to enable debugging in PQ2 wasn't entirely known. SCIWIKI stated it should be "kiss angel 187".
I originally created a patch that used "kiss angel death", but I recently discovered that typing "kiss angel of death" will toggle the debugger on and off.

The patch files I created have been moved to the ExtraCommands folder and can still be used to enable changing flags (the patch files use "kiss angel death" to enable).

There will be no confirmation message when enabling or disabling debug; You have to try a debug command to be sure.
