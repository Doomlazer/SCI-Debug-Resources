# SCI-Debug-Resources

Many of Sierra's SCI games, such as King's Quest IV, Space Quest III, etc., have built-in game specific debuggers. 

SCI0 games are typically activated with a secret phrase, such as PUMP SHARK in SQ3, but most SCI1 games require a patch file be exported and modified with a hex editor to enable. 

The goal of this resource is to:

1. Collect the most up-to-date information about these game specific debuggers.
2. Provide the needed files for people uncomfortable with hex editing or exporting patches.
3. Fix broken debug features and add new useful commands where possible.

Currently a work in progress. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
