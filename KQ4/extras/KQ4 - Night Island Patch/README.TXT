# KQ4SCI Night Island Patch 

SCI version of KQ4 only! 

To get to the island at night you must swim directly west from the fisherman's peir; you will drown attempting any other way. Head back the same way. 

## Work in progress
 
While both the AGI and SCI version of the game include some night pics for Genesta's island, several are missing, including all of the interior rooms. 

In the game it's technically impossible to visit the island at night. This mod allows Rosella to keep her wits about her just long enough to reach the island. It adds several night pics and a night time door opening animation.

Currently a work in progess, the interior castle rooms have not been started, and some of the new pics still need polish. The long shot of the castle could use some work.
