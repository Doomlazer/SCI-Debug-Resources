Police Quest 3 v1.00 debugger

INSTALLATION 

Copy 0.scr to your PQ3 game folder and start normally.


I modified main to pass events to script 899. 
The debug script is decompiles in assembly so I'll have to test what commands exist, 
but standard stuff like Alt + T for teleport seem to work.

If you delete the file "version" from your game directory you get an option at the start to change the day.
This is reportedly broken, but I haven't tested it yet.
