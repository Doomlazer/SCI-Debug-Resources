# SCI-Debug-Resources

Many of Sierra's SCI games, such as King's Quest IV, Space Quest III, etc., have built-in game specific debuggers. SCI0 games are typically activated with a secret phrase, such as PUMP SHARK in SQ3, but most SCI1 games require a patch file be exported and modified with a hex editor to enable. 

The goal of this resource is to:

1. Collect the most up-to-date information about these game specific debuggers in one place.
2. Provide the needed patch files for people uncomfortable with hex editing.
3. Fix broken debug features and add new useful commands where possible.


Currently a work in progress. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
