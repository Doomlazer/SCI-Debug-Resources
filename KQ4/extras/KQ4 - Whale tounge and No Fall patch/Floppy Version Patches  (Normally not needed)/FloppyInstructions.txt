You can tell if you have the floppy version because the Yes/No buttons when asked if "you've played KQ4 before" will be green.

If you are using the floppy version first copy the normal patches to your KQ4 game folder, then copy and replace the patches in this folder on top of those. 
This folder, itself, should not be copied, just the patch files.
