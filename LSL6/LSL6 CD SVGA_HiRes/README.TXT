The debug script #911 doesn't exist in the HiRes/SVGA version of the game files and would need to be ported form the other versions. 

I'm not sure if I'll do this or not as the SVGA version has it's own unique debugging features. Info here: http://sciwiki.sierrahelp.com/index.php/SCI_Debug_Modes#Leisure_Suit_Larry_6_.28SVGA_CD_version.29
